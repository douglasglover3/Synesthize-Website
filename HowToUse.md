To run the website locally, you need two terminals open. This is so that we can create a react server (front end) and a regular server (backend).

**Front End**

In one terminal, type **cd frontend** to enter the frontend folder. Then, open the website with **npm start**. To end the server session, use **Ctrl+c** in the terminal and then enter **y**.

**Back End**

In the other terminal, type **cd backend** to enter the backend folder. Then, launch the server with **npm start**. To end the server session, use **Ctrl+c** in the terminal and then enter **y**.
